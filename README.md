# ChartTracker

**Simple application that leverages the TradingPhysics API to display stock data for a given day.**

## Login

A login can be created, but is not required. Utilizing the Sign In Later feature will not limit the app's functionality.

## Setup

In order to successfully get data from TradingPhysics, some rules must be followed.

On the chart finder screen, a user will be able to enter data into two fields: Ticker & Date. An acceptable date would be a date that is at least one day prior to the current date. The date may not fall on a weekend or bank holiday. An acceptable stock ticker would be any valid ticker for a publicly traded company (e.g. 'QQQ'). 

Once all required fields are entered, a user must click the "Get Chart" button. The appropritate stock chart will appear. A user can then interact with the stock chart via the pinch & zoom feature. 

## Settings

A user can add a default stock ticker via the settings screen. This allows the user to have a ticker pre-populated in the ticker field on app launch.
